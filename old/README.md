## Old VulpesSceneKit source code

As I'm a lazy bum, you'll find most of the old VulpesSceneKit code in this repository. I made some significant headway with this code, and learned a lot from it - and it has provided reference code for my new architecture more than once. For this reason, and because it's not terribly easy to just have it safely stashed elsewhere, it has been left in here. 

Consider this all the non-ideal way of acheiving things - there are so many things that can be improved. But the source code for the clustered forward demo, some of the generative geometry code, and other various classes all provide useful insights still.
